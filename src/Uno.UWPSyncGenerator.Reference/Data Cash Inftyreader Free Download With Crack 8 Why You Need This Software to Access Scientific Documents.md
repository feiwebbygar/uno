## What is InftyReader?
  
InftyReader is a software developed by Science Accessibility Net, a non-profit organization that aims to make scientific information accessible to everyone. InftyReader uses three OCR engines: its own OCR engine, which is designed to recognize scientific and mathematical symbols in formulae; WinReader from MediaDrive Corp; and ExpressReaderPro from Toshiba Corporation. These OCR engines work together to improve the recognition results of characters appearing in ordinary text areas[^1^].
  
InftyReader can process black and white images of scientific documents, such as scanned papers, PDF files, or screenshots. It can not process gray-scale or color images, or pixelated images of characters. There should also be no background colors in the images being processed[^1^].
