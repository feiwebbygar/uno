## How to Use Sprint-Layout 6.0 Magyar?
 
To use Sprint-Layout 6.0 Magyar, you need to launch the program from your desktop or start menu. You will see a blank workspace where you can start designing your PCB. You can use the toolbar at the top of the screen to access various tools and functions, such as drawing lines, circles, rectangles, arcs, pads, vias, text, etc. You can also use the menu bar at the top of the screen to access other options, such as file management, view settings, grid settings, layer settings, etc. You can use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out of your PCB design, and the arrow keys to move it around.
 
To create a new PCB design, you need to click on File > New or press Ctrl+N on your keyboard. You will be asked to enter some parameters for your PCB, such as size, resolution, layers, etc. You can also choose a template from the list of predefined ones[^1^]. After entering the parameters, click OK and you will see a blank PCB on your workspace.
 
To draw your circuit diagram on your PCB, you need to use the tools on the toolbar or press the corresponding shortcut keys on your keyboard. For example, to draw a line, you need to click on the line tool or press L on your keyboard. Then you need to click on the starting point of your line and drag it to the end point. To draw a circle, you need to click on the circle tool or press C on your keyboard. Then you need to click on the center of your circle and drag it to set its radius.
 
To place components on your PCB, you need to use the component tool or press P on your keyboard. Then you need to select a component from the library or create your own one. To select a component from the library, you need to click on the component tool again or press P twice on your keyboard. Then you will see a window with various categories of components, such as resistors, capacitors, transistors, etc. You can browse through them and choose the one you want by clicking on it[^1^]. To create your own component, you need to click on Edit > Component Editor or press Ctrl+E on your keyboard. Then you will see a window where you can draw your component using lines, circles, pads, etc.
 
To place a component on your PCB, you need to drag it from the library window or the component editor window
