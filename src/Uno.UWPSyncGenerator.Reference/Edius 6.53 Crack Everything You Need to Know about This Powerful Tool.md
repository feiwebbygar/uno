- **1.5X speed playback of timeline or player window**: You can now play back your timeline or player window at 1.5 times the normal speed, which can save you time when reviewing or previewing your edits.
- **New activation method for easy off-line activation**: Edius 6.53 has a new process of offline activation and deactivation that uses a USB key. This makes it easier to activate or deactivate your license without an internet connection.

Once you have your footage in the bin, you can drag and drop it to the timeline and start editing. You can trim, split, join, crop, rotate, or resize your clips. You can also add transitions, filters, effects, titles, or graphics to enhance your video. Edius 6.53 supports unlimited tracks and layers, so you can create complex compositions and multi-camera edits.
 
Edius 6.53 also has a powerful color correction tool that lets you adjust the brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, and gamma of your video.
