Bollywood movie songs are not only entertaining, but also beneficial for the viewers. According to a study by PlanetRead, an Indian non-government organisation that promotes literacy through same-language subtitling (SLS) of Bollywood songs on TV, watching subtitled songs can improve reading skills and language proficiency. SLS is a simple and cost-effective method that displays the lyrics of the songs on the screen in sync with the audio, creating a karaoke-like effect. The viewers can read along with the songs and learn new words and spellings[^1^].
 
PlanetRead has been implementing SLS on various TV channels in India since 1999, reaching millions of viewers across different languages. The organisation claims that SLS can make 150 million early-literates into functional readers within three to five years. SLS can also help people learn other languages, such as Hindi, which is widely used in India for official and commercial purposes. For example, Chhayaben Sondha, a resident of Vadod village in Gujarat, learned Hindi by watching subtitled Bollywood songs on Rangoli, a weekly show that features Hindi film songs[^1^].
 
Bollywood movie songs are also a source of cultural expression and identity for many Indians. They reflect the diversity and richness of Indian culture, as well as the social and political issues of the times. Bollywood songs can convey emotions, values, beliefs and aspirations of the people, as well as celebrate festivals, traditions and customs. Bollywood songs can also inspire patriotism, nationalism and social awareness among the viewers. For example, some of the popular patriotic songs are "Ae Mere Watan Ke Logon" (O People of My Country), "Maa Tujhe Salaam" (Salute to You Mother) and "Chak De India" (Go India)[^2^].
