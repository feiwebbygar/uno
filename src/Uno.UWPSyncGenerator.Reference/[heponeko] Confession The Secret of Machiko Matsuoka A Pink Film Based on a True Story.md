If you are a fan of manga, you have probably heard of [heponeko], the comedy series about a cat-loving office lady and her hilarious adventures with her furry friends. The manga has been serialized in Weekly Shonen Jump since 2019 and has sold over 10 million copies worldwide. It has also been adapted into an anime series and a live-action movie.
 
But do you know who is behind this successful manga? The author and illustrator of [heponeko] is Machiko Matsuoka, a 35-year-old woman who lives in Tokyo. She is known for her cute and colorful art style, her witty humor and her love for cats. She often posts photos of her own cats on her social media accounts and interacts with her fans online.
 
## But what if we told you that Machiko Matsuoka is not who she claims to be?
 
In a shocking confession, Machiko Matsuoka has recently revealed that she is not the real creator of [heponeko]. In fact, she is not even a woman. She is actually a man named Masato Matsuda, who has been posing as a female manga artist for years.
 
How did he pull off this deception? Why did he do it? And what does this mean for the future of [heponeko]? Read on to find out!
 
### How did Masato Matsuda become Machiko Matsuoka?
 
Masato Matsuda is a 40-year-old man who works as an editor at Shueisha, the publisher of Weekly Shonen Jump. He has always loved manga and dreamed of becoming a manga artist himself. However, he lacked the talent and confidence to pursue his passion.
 
One day, he stumbled upon a blog by an amateur manga artist named Machiko Matsuoka. He was impressed by her drawings and stories, especially by her original concept of [heponeko]. He contacted her and offered to help her publish her work in Weekly Shonen Jump. She agreed and sent him her manuscripts.
 
Masato was amazed by the quality of her work and decided to submit it to his boss under his own name. He thought that he could get away with it since he was an editor and had access to the submission system. He also thought that he could use his position to promote and protect her work.
 
However, he soon realized that he had made a big mistake. His boss loved [heponeko] and wanted to meet the author in person. Masato panicked and came up with a lie. He told his boss that Machiko Matsuoka was his pen name and that he was actually a woman. He said that he was shy and preferred to work anonymously.

His boss believed him and agreed to respect his wishes. He also praised him for his talent and originality. Masato felt guilty but also happy. He had finally achieved his dream of becoming a manga artist, even if it was under a false identity.
 
### How did Masato Matsuda maintain his disguise?
 
Masato knew that he had to keep up his lie if he wanted to continue publishing [heponeko]. He decided to cut off all contact with the real Machiko Matsuoka and delete her blog. He also created fake social media accounts for his alter ego and hired a voice actress to pretend to be him in interviews and events.
 
He also bought a wig, makeup and women's clothes to disguise himself
