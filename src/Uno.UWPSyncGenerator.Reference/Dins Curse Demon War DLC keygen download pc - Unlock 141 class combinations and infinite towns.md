In Din's Curse: Demon War DLC, you play as a servant of Din, the champion of the gods, who has cursed you into a second life of service because you selfishly squandered your first one while causing misfortune to those around you[^2^]. To redeem yourself, you must help the towns of Aleria from the brink of annihilation, as they are under attack by demons, undead, and other dangers.
 
The expansion adds a new class, the Demon Hunter, who specializes in hunting down and killing demons. It also introduces many new demons (3 new species, 8 new types, 40 new variants), new quests, new environments, new world modifiers, and more[^1^]. The expansion also continues the story of the Demon War, a conflict that erupted after the death of the necromancer Ciglio, who unleashed a horde of undead that even attacked demons. The demons are furious and blame the humans for this mess. As a servant of Din, you must try to save humankind from the Demon War[^1^].
 
Din's Curse: Demon War DLC is not a typical action RPG. It has a dynamic and evolving world that reacts to your actions and choices. The towns are constantly changing, with new quests, events, NPCs, monsters, and items. The quests are not static either; they can change or fail depending on how you handle them. The towns can also be invaded by enemies, revolt against you, or even be destroyed if you don't protect them. The game also has a high level of difficulty and challenge, requiring you to think strategically and adapt to different situations.
