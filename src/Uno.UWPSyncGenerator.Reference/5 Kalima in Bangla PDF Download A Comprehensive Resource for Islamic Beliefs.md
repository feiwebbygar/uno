The 5 Kalima are not only statements of belief, but also acts of worship. They are meant to be recited with sincerity, understanding, and devotion. They are also a way of purifying one's heart and soul from the influences of shirk (associating partners with Allah), kufr (disbelief), and nifaq (hypocrisy).
 
By reciting the 5 Kalima regularly, one can strengthen one's faith and relationship with Allah. One can also gain the rewards and benefits of remembering Allah and invoking His names. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever says: 'There is no god but Allah, alone, without partner. To Him belongs all sovereignty and praise. He gives life and causes death, and He is over all things competent.' ten times in a day, will have the reward of freeing four slaves from the Children of Isma'il." (Bukhari)
 
The 5 Kalima are also a means of protection from the trials and tribulations of this world and the Hereafter. They are a shield from the evil of Satan and his allies. They are a source of guidance and light in times of darkness and confusion. They are a sign of love and loyalty to Allah and His messenger. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever says: 'I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad is His slave and messenger.' with sincerity from his heart, Allah will forbid the Fire for him."
