The adjustment program has several options and features that you can use to reset and maintain your printer. However, for this article, we will focus on how to reset the waste ink pad counter, which is one of the most common problems that Epson SX 125 users face.
 
## Step 3: Reset the Waste Ink Pad Counter
 
The waste ink pad counter is a feature that tracks how much ink is used by your printer during cleaning cycles and other operations. When the counter reaches a certain limit, it will display an error message such as "A printer's ink pad is at the end of its service life" or "Parts inside your printer are near the end of their service life". This means that your printer's waste ink pads are full and need to be replaced.
 
However, replacing the waste ink pads can be costly and time-consuming. A more convenient and cheaper option is to reset the waste ink pad counter using the adjustment program. This will clear the error message and allow you to use your printer again.
 
To reset the waste ink pad counter using the adjustment program, follow these steps:
 
1. In the adjustment program's interface, click on "Particular adjustment mode".
2. Select "Waste ink pad counter" from the list of options and click on "OK".
