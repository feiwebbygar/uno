In this article, we will show you how to use some of the features and functions of Tanner Eda V13 software. We will focus on the following topics:
 
- How to create a new project and import a schematic
- How to run simulations and view results
- How to perform layout and verification
- How to export and share your design

Let's get started!
 
## How to create a new project and import a schematic
 
To create a new project in Tanner Eda V13 software, you need to launch the Tanner Designer tool from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut. Tanner Designer is an analog verification management tool that tracks all simulations for a project. The tool displays simulation results in a convenient dashboard allowing the team to quickly see which blocks pass or fail specifications and to monitor verification progress.
 
When you launch Tanner Designer, you will see a welcome screen with some options. You can choose to create a new project, open an existing project, or browse some examples. To create a new project, click on the "New Project" button. You will be asked to enter a name and a location for your project. You can also select a template for your project from a list of options. A template is a predefined set of settings and files that can help you start your design faster. For example, you can choose a template for analog IC design, RF design, MEMS design, or mixed-signal design.
 
After creating your new project, you will see the main window of Tanner Designer with some tabs and panels. The tabs are Project, Schematic, Simulation, Layout, Verification, and Report. The panels are Project Explorer, Properties, Messages, and Dashboard. You can use these tabs and panels to manage your project and perform various tasks.
 
To import a schematic into your project, you need to switch to the Schematic tab. A schematic is a graphical representation of your circuit using symbols and wires. You can create your own schematic using the L-Edit tool or import an existing schematic from another tool or format. To import a schematic, click on the "Import" button on the toolbar and select the source and format of your schematic. You can import schematics from Cadence Virtuoso, Mentor Graphics Pyxis, Synopsys Custom Compiler, or SPICE netlist formats.
 
After importing your schematic, you will see it in the Schematic Editor window. You can use the tools on the toolbar and the menu bar to edit your schematic. You can add or delete components, wires, labels, ports, etc. You can also use the Properties panel to change the attributes of your components, such as values, models, parameters, etc.
