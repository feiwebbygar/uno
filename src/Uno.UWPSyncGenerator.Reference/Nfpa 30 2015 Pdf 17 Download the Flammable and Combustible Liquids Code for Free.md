NFPA 30 is a code that provides safeguards to reduce the hazards associated with flammable and combustible liquids. It is enforceable under OSHA and many state and local regulations. It covers topics such as:
 
- Classification of liquids based on their flash point and boiling point
- Design and construction of tanks, piping, valves, pumps, and other equipment
- Installation and maintenance of ventilation, fire protection, electrical, and grounding systems
- Spill control and emergency response procedures
- Fire prevention and protection practices

NFPA 30 is updated every three years to reflect the latest research, technology, and industry best practices. The current edition is NFPA 30-2021, which was published in September 2020. It includes significant changes such as:

- New definitions for terms such as aerosol container, bulk plant, combustible liquid, flammable liquid, intermediate bulk container, portable tank, and safety can
- New requirements for the storage of liquids in plastic containers and intermediate bulk containers
- New provisions for the use of wireless tank gauging systems
- New criteria for the design of fire-resistant tanks
- New guidance for the evaluation of fire hazards of liquids with unknown properties

## How to Apply NFPA 30 in Your Workplace
 
NFPA 30 is a comprehensive code that covers many aspects of flammable and combustible liquids. However, it is not a substitute for common sense and good judgment. You still need to follow some basic steps to ensure the safety of yourself and others in your workplace. Here are some tips on how to apply NFPA 30 in your daily operations:

1. Know the properties and hazards of the liquids you work with. Read the safety data sheets (SDS) and labels of the products you use and store. Learn how to identify and classify liquids based on their flash point and boiling point. Know the signs and symptoms of exposure and the appropriate first aid measures.
2. Use the proper containers and equipment for the liquids you handle. Choose containers that are compatible with the liquid and have adequate venting, sealing, and labeling features. Use pumps, valves, hoses, fittings, and other equipment that are designed for flammable and combustible liquids. Inspect and maintain your containers and equipment regularly to prevent leaks, spills, or failures.
3. Store your liquids in a safe and secure location. Follow the NFPA 30 requirements for the design and construction of storage tanks and rooms. Keep your storage areas clean, organized, and well-ventilated. Avoid storing incompatible or reactive liquids together. Limit the quantity of liquids you store to the minimum necessary for your operations.
4. Handle your liquids with care and caution. Follow the NFPA 30 guidelines for the transfer, dispensing, mixing, and use of flammable and combustible liquids. Use proper personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, goggles, aprons, and respirators. Avoid sources of ignition such as sparks, flames, or static electricity. Use grounding and bonding devices to prevent electrostatic discharge.
5. Prepare for emergencies and incidents involving flammable and combustible liquids. Follow the NFPA 30 recommendations for spill control and fire protection systems. Have a written emergency plan that outlines the roles and responsibilities of your staff in case of a fire or spill. Train your staff on how to respond to emergencies and incidents involving flammable and combustible liquids. Conduct regular drills and exercises to test your preparedness.

By following these steps, you can apply NFPA 30 in your workplace and reduce the risks associated with flammable and combustible liquids. Remember that NFPA 30 is not a one-size-fits-all solution. You may need to consult other codes, standards, regulations, or experts for specific situations or scenarios. Always seek professional advice if you have any doubts or questions about NFPA 30 or flammable and combustible liquids.
